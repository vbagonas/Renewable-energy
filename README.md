# Renewable energy
This is my group project for data visualization course unit at Vilnius University. This project aims to analyze the role of renewable energy in the energy sector and compare it with other energy sources. The research focuses on the period from 2000 to 2021 across European countries, investigating various aspects of renewable energy generation, consumption, efficiency, and its impact on greenhouse gas emissions.

Project Goals and Objectives:

1. Examine the increase in the share of renewable energy generation in European countries from 2000 to 2021.
2. Analyze the relationship between the production and consumption of renewable energy in European countries.
3. Investigate the correlation between a country's energy independence and its renewable energy production.
4. Assess the impact of renewable energy consumption on greenhouse gas emissions.
5. Compare the maintenance costs and efficiency of different renewable energy generation technologies from 2010 to 2022.
6. Study the trends in international energy product exports from 2000 to 2022.
